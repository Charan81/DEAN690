# Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Querying for Supply Chain Management

As a part of the George Mason University graduate program in Data Analytics Engineering, this repository is in place for the Data Analytics Capstone Project. For this project, researchers Sri Charan Borra, Nick DeGirolamo, Navy Merianda, Pei-shan Hsia, Maazuddin Mohammed, and Satya Sai Jayanth Devineni ("Team Avengers") created a tool for performing entity resolution on a procurement dataset and enabling natural language querying.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

## Usage

While current usage is specialized to the proprietary datasets we are working with, the methodology can be applied to any procurement set. Data is first fed through the processing script, then the entity resolution process, and finally connected to a NL query-enabled interface. For a test data set, please visit http://beta.sam.gov for an example procurement dataset with similar fields.
